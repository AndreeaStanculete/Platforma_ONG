
Each person has things in their home they no longer need and rather than throwing them out, we can choose to give them a new life by donating them. 
But maybe people aren't sure where they can donate their clothes, toys, books and even furniture. 
That's where the NGO platforms comes to aid! 

Users can choose the city where they want to make a donation, add filters regarding what they want to donate, and the application will display a Google Maps with possible drop-out points near them. 

The application's interface is simple, with only the required functionalities. 
The main page has a button from where the user will be redirected to the donation page and a second button for NGOs' members to claim their organisations. This allows them to create an account and update data based on what donations their organisation need.
